Added quite a few *long* overdue fixes & enhancements sent in by various people.

* Added latex escaping 'l' method (Thanks, Benjamin Quorning)
* Added support for @options_for_rtex hash for configuration:
  * Added :tempdir option, and changed default temporary directory
    (Thanks, Francesco Levorato)
  * Added :preprocess option to support running through latex before pdflatex
    (Thanks Charles Lesburg, Benjamin Quorning)
  * Moved old @filename setting to :filename option in this hash

If you're using the same settings for @options_for_rtex often, you might want to 
put your assignment in a before_filter (perhaps overriding :filename, etc in your actions).
